## Ternary Search Algorithm

It is generally based on divide and conquer algorithm. This algorithm is used to find an element in an array.


## Input and Output

**Input** :- 1) An array of values.
            2) The item to be searched.

**Output**:- If the element is present in the array, the output should be **The element is present in the array**. Otherwise, the output should be **The element is absent**            

### Points to remember:-

1. The given array must be in sorted order. If it is not sorted, make the array sorted.
2. The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1).
3. The best case time complexity of this algorithm is O(1).
4. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log3(n)), where n is the size of the array.
5. The given code is the recursive approach of Ternary Search Algorithm.
